# Cybersecurity Career Paths

## Introduction

Cybersecurity is a fast-growing field with high salaries and strong job demand, offering roles from offensive penetration testing to defensive security. Careers in this industry are attractive because they provide:

- **High pay** with strong starting salaries  
- **Exciting work** such as ethical hacking and defending against attacks  
- **High demand** with over 3.5 million unfilled positions worldwide  

This lesson introduces different cybersecurity roles and provides learning paths to help beginners start building the skills needed to enter the field.

## Security Analyst

Security Analysts play a key role in protecting organizations by assessing networks, identifying vulnerabilities, and recommending preventative measures. They collaborate with stakeholders to understand security needs, document risks, and design security plans that address emerging threats.

**Core Responsibilities:**

- Analyze company-wide cybersecurity with stakeholders  
- Produce reports on network safety and responses to incidents  
- Develop security strategies informed by research on new attack tools and trends

## Security Engineer

Security Engineers design and implement defenses based on threat and vulnerability data. Their work spans preventing web application attacks, countering network threats, and adapting to evolving tactics. The primary goal is to maintain strong security measures that reduce risks of attacks and data loss.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Test and evaluate security measures across software systems  
- Monitor networks and analyze reports to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities  
- Identify, design, and implement systems to ensure optimal security

## Incident Responder

Incident Responders handle security breaches in real time, ensuring swift and effective action to limit damage. They create and enforce incident response plans, policies, and protocols, often under high pressure as attacks unfold. Success is measured by key metrics:

- **MTTD** – Mean Time to Detect  
- **MTTA** – Mean Time to Acknowledge  
- **MTTR** – Mean Time to Recover  

The ultimate goal is to protect the organization’s data, reputation, and financial stability while minimizing breach impact.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Develop and maintain actionable incident response plans  
- Enforce strong security best practices and support response measures  
- Conduct post‑incident reporting, analysis, and improvements for future resilience

## Digital Forensics Examiner

Digital Forensics Examiners act as investigators, applying detective‑like skills to uncover evidence. In law enforcement, they collect and analyze digital data to solve crimes, identify perpetrators, and clear the innocent. In corporate settings, they investigate incidents such as policy violations or breaches, ensuring findings are accurate and legally sound.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Collect digital evidence while adhering to legal and procedural standards  
- Analyze evidence to uncover facts relevant to the case or incident  
- Document findings and produce clear, actionable reports

## Malware Analyst

Malware Analysts investigate suspicious programs to uncover their behavior and impact. Often called *reverse engineers*, they deconstruct compiled code into readable form—typically using low‑level languages like Assembly or C. Their goal is to understand malicious activity, develop detection methods, and report findings.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Perform **static analysis** by reverse‑engineering malicious code  
- Conduct **dynamic analysis** by observing malware behavior in a controlled environment  
- Document and report all findings for detection and defense strategies  

---

## Penetration Tester

Penetration Testers (also called *pentesters* or *ethical hackers*) assess the security of systems, networks, and applications by simulating real-world attacks. They identify and exploit vulnerabilities to evaluate risk, providing organizations with actionable insights to strengthen defenses and prevent cyberattacks.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Conduct penetration tests on systems, networks, and web applications  
- Perform security assessments, audits, and policy analysis  
- Document findings, evaluate risks, and recommend preventive measures

## Red Teamer

Red Teamers are similar to penetration testers but with a sharper focus: instead of broadly identifying vulnerabilities, they test an organization’s **detection and response capabilities**. By imitating real-world threat actors, they emulate malicious attacks, maintain access, and avoid detection. Red team engagements often run for weeks and are typically conducted by external specialists, making them best suited for organizations with mature security programs.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Emulate threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities, maintain persistence, and evade detection  
- Assess the effectiveness of security controls, threat intelligence, and incident response procedures  
- Provide detailed evaluations and actionable recommendations to strengthen defenses against real-world attacks
