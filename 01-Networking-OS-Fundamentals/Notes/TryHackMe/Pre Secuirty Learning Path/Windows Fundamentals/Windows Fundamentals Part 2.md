- Incorrect edits can disrupt normal system operations.

## üîß Accessing the Registry

- One common method: **Registry Editor (regedit)**.
- Other methods exist, but all require caution.

## ‚úÖ In Short

The **Windows Registry** is the backbone of Windows configuration, storing critical system, user, and application settings. It‚Äôs powerful but risky‚Äîchanges should only be made by experienced users.

### Conclusion

- The tasks covered were examples of tools that can be launched from **MSConfig**.
- **Commands and shortcuts** were provided, so you don‚Äôt need to open MSConfig to access these utilities.
- Many of these tools can also be launched directly from the **Start Menu**.
- Some MSConfig-listed tools were:
    - Already covered in **Windows Fundamentals 1**, or
    - Left for you to **explore independently**.

‚úÖ **In short**: MSConfig is one way to access system utilities, but most can also be run via shortcuts or the Start Menu, and not every tool was covered in this module.
