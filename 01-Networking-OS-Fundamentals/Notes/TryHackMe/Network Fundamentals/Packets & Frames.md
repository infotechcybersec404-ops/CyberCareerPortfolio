### What are Packets and Frames

- **Packets**:
  - Exist at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** of the OSI model.
  - Contain an **IP header** and **payload** (the actual data).
  - Used when discussing **IP addresses**.
- **Frames**:
  - Exist at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**.
  - **Encapsulate packets** and add extra info like **MAC addresses**.
  - Comparable to an **envelope** carrying a letter (the packet).

### 🔄 Encapsulation

- Process where a **packet is wrapped inside a frame** for transmission.
- At the destination, the frame is stripped away, leaving the packet to be processed.

### ⚡ Why Packets Matter

- Data is broken into **small chunks** to avoid network bottlenecks.
- Example: An image loads in **packets**, then is reassembled on your device.

### 🌐 Standards & Protocols

- Networking relies on **protocols** to ensure billions of devices communicate reliably.
- Without standardization, data transfer would break down.

### 📑 Internet Protocol (IP) Packet Headers

- **Time to Live (TTL):** Prevents packets from endlessly circulating.
- **Checksum:** Ensures data integrity; detects corruption.
- **Source Address:** IP of the sender.
- **Destination Address:** IP of the receiver.

👉 In short: **Frames move packets across local networks, while packets carry the actual data across devices. Encapsulation ensures smooth delivery, and headers provide essential instructions for routing and integrity.**

### TCP/IP (The Three-way Handshake)

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** is part of the **TCP/IP model** (4 layers: Application, Transport, Internet, Network Interface).
- Works similarly to the OSI model, using **encapsulation** (adding headers at each layer) and **decapsulation** (removing them).
- **Connection-based protocol** → requires a connection before data transfer.
- **Reliable** → guarantees delivery of data in the correct order.

## ✅ Advantages vs ❌ Disadvantages of TCP

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| Ensures data integrity | Requires a reliable connection |
| Synchronizes devices to prevent flooding/out-of-order data | If one piece is missing, the whole chunk must be resent |
| Provides reliability through multiple processes | Slower than UDP due to overhead |

## 📑 TCP Packet Headers

- **Source Port** → Random port chosen by sender.
- **Destination Port** → Port of the service on the receiver (e.g., 80 for HTTP).
- **Source IP / Destination IP** → Identifies sender and receiver devices.
- **Sequence Number** → Random starting number for ordering data.
- **Acknowledgement Number** → Confirms receipt; increments sequence by 1.
- **Checksum** → Ensures integrity (detects corruption).
- **Data** → Actual payload (file bytes, etc.).
- **Flag** → Controls behavior (e.g., during handshake).

## 🤝 The Three-Way Handshake

1. **SYN** → Client requests connection, sends Initial Sequence Number (ISN).
2. **SYN/ACK** → Server acknowledges and shares its own ISN.
3. **ACK** → Client acknowledges server’s ISN.  
➡️ Connection established, data transfer begins.

**Other messages:**
- **DATA** → Actual information sent.
- **FIN** → Graceful connection close.
- **RST** → Abrupt termination (error/failure).

## 🔢 Sequence Numbers

- Each data segment is numbered.
- Both devices agree on sequence numbers during the handshake.
- Ensures data is reconstructed in the correct order.

## 🔒 Closing a TCP Connection

- Device sends **FIN** → other device acknowledges.
- Both sides exchange FIN/ACK to confirm closure.
- Frees up system resources.

👉 In short: **TCP is a reliable, connection-based protocol that ensures ordered, error-checked delivery of data using sequence numbers, acknowledgements, and the three-way handshake.**

### UDP/IP

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** is a **stateless, connectionless protocol**.
- Unlike TCP, it does **not** use a Three-way handshake or maintain synchronization between devices.
- Best suited for applications where **speed matters more than reliability**, e.g., **video streaming, online gaming, or voice chat**.

## ✅ Advantages vs ❌ Disadvantages of UDP

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| Much **faster** than TCP (no handshake, less overhead). | No guarantee data is received. |
| Leaves **flow control** to the application, giving developers flexibility. | No error correction or retransmission safeguards. |
| Does not reserve a continuous connection (lighter on resources). | Unstable connections → poor user experience. |

## 📑 UDP Packet Headers

UDP packets are **simpler** than TCP packets, with fewer headers. Key fields include:

- **Time to Live (TTL):** Prevents packets from circulating endlessly.
- **Source Address:** IP of the sender.
- **Destination Address:** IP of the receiver.
- **Source Port:** Random port chosen by sender.
- **Destination Port:** Port of the receiving service (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 53 for DNS).
- **Data:** The actual payload (bytes being transmitted).

## 🔑 Key Differences from TCP

- **No connection setup** → no SYN, ACK, or FIN messages.
- **No acknowledgements** → packets may be lost without notice.
- **No sequencing** → packets may arrive out of order.
- **Lightweight and fast** → ideal for real-time applications where occasional loss is acceptable.

👉 In short: **UDP trades reliability for speed.** It’s perfect when performance is critical and minor data loss won’t break the application, unlike TCP which prioritizes accuracy and order.

### Ports 101

- **Analogy**: Like ships docking at a harbour, data must use the correct **port** to connect.
- **Definition**: A port is a **numerical value (0–65,535)** used to identify specific processes or services on a device.
- **Purpose**: Ensures data is delivered to the right application/service.

## 📊 Port Ranges

- **0–1023** → *Well-known / Common ports* (standardized for key protocols).
- **1024–49151** → *Registered ports* (assigned to specific applications).
- **49152–65535** → *Dynamic/private ports* (often used temporarily by clients).

## 🌐 Common Protocols & Ports

| Protocol | Port | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **FTP** | 21 | Transfers files between client and server. |
| **SSH** | 22 | Secure remote login via text interface. |
| **HTTP** | 80 | Standard web traffic (unencrypted). |
| **HTTPS** | 443 | Secure web traffic (encrypted). |
| **SMB** | 445 | File and printer sharing. |
| **RDP** | 3389 | Remote desktop access with GUI. |

## 🔑 Key Notes

- **Standardization**: Ports prevent chaos by assigning consistent rules (e.g., all browsers use port 80 for HTTP).
- **Flexibility**: Applications can run on **non-standard ports** (e.g., web server on `8080` instead of `80`).  
  - In such cases, the port must be specified explicitly (e.g., `http://example.com:8080`).

👉 In short: **Ports act as communication endpoints that direct data to the right service. Standard ports keep things organized, but custom ports can be used when needed.**
