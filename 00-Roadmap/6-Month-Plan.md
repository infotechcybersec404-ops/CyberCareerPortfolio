# 6-Month Cybersecurity Transition Plan
## 🗓️ 6‑Month Cybersecurity Transition Roadmap

### **Month 1–2: Lay the Groundwork**

- **Networking & OS Fundamentals**
  - Study TCP/IP, OSI model, DNS, DHCP, routing basics.
  - Practice Linux + Windows admin tasks (Active Directory, Group Policy, PowerShell basics).
- **Cert Prep Kickoff**
  - Begin *CompTIA Security+* study (use Professor Messer videos + practice exams).
- **Hands‑On Labs**
  - Start *TryHackMe* “Pre‑Security” and “SOC Level 1” paths.
- **Portfolio**
  - Create a GitHub repo or blog where you post study notes, cheat sheets, or lab walkthroughs.

### **Month 3–4: Build Security Skills**

- **Cert Progress**
  - Continue Security+ prep, aim to schedule exam by end of Month 4.
- **Practical SOC Skills**
  - Work through *HackTheBox Academy Jr. SOC Analyst* modules.
  - Set up a home lab:
    - Install a SIEM (e.g., Splunk free, Wazuh, or Security Onion).
    - Generate logs and practice analyzing alerts.
- **Portfolio**
  - Write a short case study: “How I detected a brute force attack in my lab.”

### **Month 5: Transition to Job‑Ready**

- **Cert Exam**
  - Sit for *Security+*. Passing this gives you a strong credential for entry‑level IT/security roles.
- **Resume & LinkedIn**
  - Highlight:
    - Security+ (or “in progress” if not yet passed).
    - Hands‑on labs (SOC monitoring, SIEM setup, TryHackMe/HTB progress).
    - Transferable FedEx skills (reliability, handling sensitive data, working under pressure).
- **Networking**
  - Join local cyber meetups or online groups. Start connecting with SOC analysts, IT techs, and recruiters.

### **Month 6: Apply & Pivot**

- **Job Applications**
  - Target: Help Desk, IT Support, NOC Technician, Jr. SOC Analyst.
  - Apply broadly—entry‑level IT is often the stepping stone into security.
- **Keep Learning**
  - If you land IT role → focus on security tasks internally.
  - If not yet → continue with *HTB Jr. SOC Analyst* cert and labs to strengthen your profile.
